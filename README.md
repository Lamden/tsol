# Templated Solidity
### Jinja + Solidity = Smart Templates

```pip install tsol```

We templated Solidity code so that we can reuse and deploy common contracts with ease and start to create better interfaces for things such as ERC20 token creation and smart asset generation. So instead of copying and pasting some Solidity code from some wiki, we can store all the commonly used contracts on Flora in a way that allows them to be simply modified with a JSON payload. That way, we keep the standardization where needed, and pop out the customizable metavariables when we need to.

Thus, Templated Solidity.

This library is a helper for commonly used functions in the Lamden suite and can be used in your own projects. It includes turning JSON and TSOL into pure Solidity and quick Solidity compilation tools for error checking.

Enjoy!
